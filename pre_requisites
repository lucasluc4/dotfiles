This is a list of dependencies necessary to run each of the configuration modules.
Eventually, maybe, I can automatize the instalation of those programs.

[i3]
kitty: set as default terminal
feh: for background

[zsh]
zsh and zsh-completions: the default shell - then run chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh to set zsh as default
oh-my-zsh: to make terminal look beautiful
ttf-meslo-nerd and ttf-fira-code: default fonts
